# Demystifying Artificial Intelligence

iVantage Retreat 2016


## What is AI?

Computer system that behaves in an intelligent way


	## Areas of Intelligence

	- Learning
	- Perception
	- Knowledge representation
	- Prediction
	- Natural Language Processing


	### The Turing Test for Intelligence

	A human interacts with a partner through a terminal. If the human
	judges their partner to be human, the computer is considered
	to be *intelligent*.

##  Machine Learning

Machine Learning refers to the process of teaching a skill to a computer by supplying training data and allowing the computer to adjust itself to mimick the desired functionality.


## Training Steps

1. Supply the training input
2. Process the input according to the existing weights
3. Compare the training output to the actual output
4. Adjust the weights based on the difference between the training and actual outputs
5. Repeat

With each iteration the set of weights gets closer to mimicking the desired functionality


## Methods of Artificial Intelligence

- Searching
- Probabilistic Models
- Neural Networks


	## Searching

	Try many possible solutions in order to find the best outcome

	> Used by IBM's Deep Blue Chess AI

	## Neural Networks

	Imitates the biological network of neurons in the brain.

	A trained network can be used for classification, decision making, etc.
