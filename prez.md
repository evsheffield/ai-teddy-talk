# Demystifying Artificial Intelligence

iVantage Retreat 2016


## What is AI?

Computer system that behaves in an intelligent way


	## Areas of Intelligence

	- Learning
	- Perception
	- Knowledge representation
	- Prediction
	- Natural Language Processing


	### The Turing Test for Intelligence

	A human interacts with a partner through a terminal. If the human
	judges their partner to be human, the computer is considered
	to be *intelligent*.

## Applications of AI


	## Self-driving cars

	- Perception, Computer Vision
	- Learning
	- Planning

##  Machine Learning

Machine Learning refers to the process of teaching a skill to a computer by supplying training data and allowing the computer to adjust itself to mimick the desired functionality.


## Training Steps

With each iteration the system gets closer to mimicking the desired functionality


## Methods of Artificial Intelligence

- Searching
- Probabilistic Models
- Neural Networks


	## Searching

	Try many possible solutions in order to find the best outcome

	> Used by IBM's Deep Blue Chess AI

	## Neural Networks

	Imitates the biological network of neurons in the brain.

	A trained network can be used for classification, decision making, etc.
